					<h3>Weather App</h3></a>
					<p>This nice little app uses your browser's built in geolocation capabilities and the forecast.io API to detect where in the world you are and instantly serve up the weather for the week. It's design is kept simple and clean with Bootstrap, JQuery powers much of the DOM selection/modification making for clean code, and the background will even change depending on the weather outside! It's a must-have tool for any developer needing to know what's going on outside without leaving his or her desk.<br>

					<h3>Javascript Calculator</h3></a>
					<p>This little app was probably one of the more fun ones to build. Getting the inputs to calculate correctly without using eval(), which many suggest to use sparingly, was a challenge. The design was made when I was still getting familiar with the design side of things so the color pallet differs widely from my more recent work below but is perfect to show my progression as I have matured as a developer. It uses all of the standard technologies one would expect (listed below) with a little extra help from BigNumber.js to smooth out the rounding. Overall it is an amazing project I am likely to revisit in the future. (Click the picture or title to check it out.)</p>

					<h3>Simon Says</h3></a>
					<p>I was inspired to code this project by FreeCodeCamp but also so my little brother could have something to play on his Ipad. It represents a fun experience that did a lot to strengthen my understanding of object orientation, the use of different types of media in a webpage, and program control flow. It was also a good exercise in my use of SCSS and was in fact the reason that I went on to fall in love with the CSS preprocessor. This is one of my more recent and better put together projects..<br>

					<h3>Hang Man</h3></a>
					<p>This project was more of an experiment to improve my ability to work with and manipulate the DOM and by finishing it I learned a lot. I also was able to use canvas for the first time and learned to render (very simplistic) graphics. The code written in this project in particular I would consider some of my better organized, and most varied as far as the approches to solving the issues faced. In short though, it was a fun, quick side project to keep my brain going between larger undertakings and an app that I would love to revisit and refactor in the future. <br>

					<h3>Responsive HTML Email</h3></a>
					<p>Built and tested in Litmus, this represents one of my first forays into the exciting world of responsive HTML emails. Relearning best practices and adjusting to the different ecosystem and design patterns were challenging at first but ultimately ended up being a rather fun bit of experience. After this project I can happily say I am a much more versatile and flexible developer.<br>

				<h2>More About Me</h2>
				<img class="avatar centered-div" src="Images/avatar.jpg">

				<div class="centered-div about-me">
				<h3>Who am I?</h3>
					<p>I gave a short description of myself above, but allow me to expand on my goals, achievments, and experiences. I am a Atlanta web developer who is currently on track to recieve a degree in Software Development. Although I have been taught the more general tenants of Software Development in a more traditional capacity, when it comes to to web development I am a self taught self-starter. I enjoy taking part in the web development community and attend meet-ups and hackathons whenever the chances present themselves. I also am an avid user of the open source Free Code Camp where I do daily coding challenges to keep my skills sharp as well as try my best to assist fledgling developers as they start their journey of self teaching as I did.</p>
					<h3>What is my experience?</h3>

					<p class="listed-p">I have been adamant about doing more than having my experiences in the development world be confined to personal projects almost from the moment I started learning. I have been active in my community as a volunteer by offering up my abilities for charities in the area and have had a relatively successful experience in the professional sphere. <strong>My experiences include:</strong> 
					<ul>
						<li>Working at a job where I was 1/3 of a dev team that worked to rebuild 7 international sites from the ground up. This included the building the CSS, C# back-end, Javascript, lead tracking services, and revamping the MVC archetecture.</li>
						<li>Building a mobile app that was used by over 3,000 people at my companies biggest event of the year.</li>
						<li>Building a website for a charity meant to give scholarships to underprivileged international students.</li>
						<li>At my job I also recieved the "High Impact" award, an award only given to those who have a large and tangable effect on the buisness, for my work on the aforementioned app and was recognized by the CEO of the company.</li>
					</ul>
